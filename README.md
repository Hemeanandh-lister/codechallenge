This repo contains solution for two problems:

# Problem 1 - Sorting Odd Numbers first in an Array.
This program receives an array from user and sorts the array in such a way that all the odd numbers are sorted first and then the even numbers are sorted.
Eg: If user inputs [2, 365, 6, 4], the sorted array would be [365, 2, 4, 6].

Compile and run:https://github.com/hemeanandh/CodingChallenge/blob/master/src/main/java/SortOddEven.java

To run Test cases:https://github.com/hemeanandh/CodingChallenge/blob/master/src/test/java/Service/SortingServiceTest.java

# Problem 2 - Finding all the permutation of an Array
This program receives an array from user and prints all the possible permutations of the array.
Eg: If user inputs [2, 2, 3], output will be [2, 2, 3], [2, 3, 2], [3, 2, 2]
